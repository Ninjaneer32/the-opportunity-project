  Background: "Every decade, in years ending in \u201C0,\u201D the U.S. Census Bureau\
    \ conducts its Decennial Census, apportioning representation in the U.S. House\
    \ of Representatives, as well as federal funds for critical infrastructure and\
    \ services such as housing, highways, schools, hospitals, and scores of programs\
    \ that are vital to the health and welfare of the U.S. population and economy.In\
    \ addition to the Decennial Census, the U.S. Census Bureau conducts other critical\
    \ surveys such as the Economic Census and the American Community Survey, which\
    \ can help businesses do their planning, and measure the health of our economy\
    \ and places. It is critical that all those living in the U.S. participate in\
    \ the Census. It is therefore vital that people know the impact that Census has\
    \ on their lives, families, communities, and societies. Yet certain groups have\
    \ been undercounted at disproportionately high rates, including rural communities,\

  Vision for sprint outcomes: People living in America know the impact of the Census
    on their lives, family, community and society, and are therefore are driven to
    participate. Learning how to take the Census will be as easy as going to vote.gov.
  Why this problem matters: "When people and businesses participate in the Census,\
    \ they further drive its value by ensuring a complete count. Having an accurate\
    \ count then ensures the fair distribution of federal spending and apportionment\
    \ of congressional seats. When segments of the population are undercounted, it\
    \ results in fewer resources allocated, imprecise policy recommendations, and\
    \ less congressional representation for those communities. The 2020 Census will\
    \ also be the first to have an online response option, presenting new challenges\
    \ with those who aren\u2019t digitally connected, but also opening up new opportunities\
    \ for creative solutions."

    facilities and infrastructure.
  Why this problem matters: Recycling facilities, ranging from those operated by large
    waste management corporations to smaller, family-owned facilities, process the
    nearly 70M tons of material that Americans throw into their recycling bins each
    year. While international markets were historically significant purchasers of
    materials from these U.S. recycling facilities, recent years have seen tightening
    of international markets, due largely to contamination of traditional recycling
    streams by newer products (e.g., plastic bags, flexible pouches, and lithium batteries),
    which our outdated recycling infrastructure is ill-equipped to manage. Many recycling
    facilities are unable to fill the gap left by international markets, as they are
    not connected to domestic manufacturers (e.g., paper mills, bottling plants) that
    have demand for using these recycled materials in new products. These dynamics
    have contributed to recycling programs across the country shrinking or even shutting
    down.

  Background: Many state and local governments do not have a database of addresses
    with geospatial coordinates (also known as address point data), which is critical
    for high priority issues like emergency response. In some cases, where the governments
    have address point data, it is not openly available due to propriety or legal
    constraints. Many state and local governments do not have the resources to plan,
    implement, and maintain address point data collection activities. Resources needed

  Vision for sprint outcomes: Outcomes from The Opportunity Project provide the momentum
    needed for tribal, state, and local governments to begin to fill in address point
    data gaps across the nation and to share the data openly, and help to share best
    practices for workflows and processes, including metadata
  Why this problem matters: 'Tribal, state, and local address point data are critical
    to all levels of government. During catastrophic events such as hurricanes and
    wild fires, residences and businesses cannot be located using traditional means
    of address navigation since the structures, street signs, and landmarks no longer
    exist. An easily accessible data base of reliable, accurate, and uniform/standardized
    address point data can meet the immediate needs of emergency responders and communities
    in crisis. A complete address data base is also needed to accurately count citizens
    through censuses and surveys in order for governments to receive their share of
    federal funds and be accurately represented. For example, in 2015, Census Bureau
    data was used to distribute more than $675 billion in funds. Address data is also
    critical for the Master Address File (MAF) used for the decennial census and ongoing
    surveys. For the Department of Transportation (DOT), complete, accurate, and up-to-date
    addresses with location data is critical to transportation safety and the National
    911 Program, which envisions an emergency response system that best serves the
    public, providing immediate help in all emergency situations. Mail delivery, real
    estate and land use decisions, and public health tracking also depend on address
    point data. The Census Bureau and DOT are committed to improving data completeness,
    accuracy and currency, which are key to successful development of a National Address
    Database (NAD) as a National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDA). '

  Background: To many Americans ,earning a 4-year university degree is held up as
    the most attractive, prestigious or only path toward a successful career. Yet,
    educational institutions, companies, unions, and other entities are increasingly
    creating multiple, alternative pathways to careers, including apprenticeships,
    secondary career and technical education programs, community college degree and
    certificate programs, boot camps, industry certificates, combinations of the above,
    and new programs that have not yet been invented. These programs unfairly lack
    the prestige of a college degree, when they often could link to a college degree,
    possibly paid for by an employer. This is in part because for the past several
    decades, American higher education and workforce development has focused on encouraging
    high school students to attend college after graduation. In contrast, in countries
    like Germany and Switzerland, career and technical education, including apprenticeships,
    is highly prestigious in society and culture. While college can be very beneficial
    for many people, it ignores a large swath of Americans who don't necessarily want
    to attend college right after school, don't want to accrue tens of thousands of
    dollars in student loan debt, or who simply want to enter the workforce immediately
    after graduation. To realize the true potential of the American workforce, students
    need to be fully aware of all pathways to careers. Educational institutions, companies,
    unions, and other organizations need to market them as attractive, prestigious,
    and cost-effective career paths for young people. In short, multiple pathways
    need to be easier to find.
  Challenge: Create digital tools that help American workers to consider and take
    advantage of the multiple pathways available to find or advance in careers. Tools
    could 1)make multiple pathways to career success more attractive by helping people
    envision them as exciting and prestigious, and/or 2) help to make data on these
    opportunities user friendly and discoverable by American workers.

  Target audience / End user: Decision-makers (e.g. superintendents, principals, school
    board members, state departments of education), municipal leaders (e.g. mayors,
    city council members), and parents
  Vision for sprint outcomes: A local superintendent sees that students in a certain
    part of his district do not have the same access to rigorous coursework as those
    in another part and adjusts course offerings by making different decisions around
    human capital and budgeting. A principal sees that her school has far fewer actual
    resources than a school with a similar demographic of students and uses the data
    to make their case to the school board and superintendent for additional resources.
    A parent sees gaps between groups (e.g. English learners and non-English learners)
    of students citywide in access to experienced teachers, investigates and discovers
    that is because there is not enough support given to teachers of ELs so they turnover
    more frequently, and works with the school district and school board to address
    those gaps.
  Why this problem matters: 'Within and across school districts and communities there
    are significant disparities in outcomes (e.g. achievement, graduation rate) between
    different student groups, in whole or in part due to inequitable access to resources
    (e.g. per-pupil expenditures, rigorous coursework, effective teachers). Decision-makers
    (e.g. superintendents, principals, school board members, state departments of
    education), municipal leaders (e.g. mayors, city council members), and parents

  Background: 'Knowledge, technology, and innovation are the engines of our economy
    -- without them, regions and the economy as a whole would fail to grow.  Over
    the last 20 years, economic and technological forces have shifted the American
    economic landscape from a manufacturing and agricultural economy to a knowledge-based
    economy, making knowledge even more important to the future of the workforce and
    economic growth. To drive business innovation and productive regional economies,
    communities across the U.S. need intellectual capital, but there is an increasing
    geographic divide in talent.  Large cities like Boston, New York, and San Francisco
    have seen a decade of entrepreneurship growth and increasing capital investment,
    and boast a burgeoning entrepreneurial ecosystem of business incubators, accelerators,
    and high-growth companies. But mid-sized cities (with 250,000-1 million residents)
    across the U.S. are just starting to experience similar activity. In these places
    where talent pools are less concentrated and more nascent, discovering the right
    talent is a major barrier for high-growth companies looking to launch and scale.

  Background: The Federal government has extensive data that currently exists in silos.
    Agencies maintain data about their programs, open data sources maintain various
    elements of meta data, and government-wide systems like Performance.gov and USASpending.gov
    hold data about specific areas of Federal operations. Although the Federal government
    has made strides with improving accountability and transparency, linking these
    data sets together would tell a holistic story of federal financial management.
  Challenge: Develop public facing tools that link federal spending and performance
    (or outcome) data to provide comprehensive insight into the use of federal taxpayer
    dollars across programs.

    allowing the American public to track progress in key areas, unlock economic opportunities,
    and expand research capabilities. '
  Why this problem matters: "In 2017, the Federal government spent over $3 trillion\
    \ dollars in financial assistance. While USASpending.gov provides access to federal\
    \ spending data at lower levels of granularity, there is still an opportunity\
    \ to enhance transparency and show the American public how programs are performing\
    \ with tax payer dollars. With an increase in spending in high impact areas such\
    \ as disaster relief, there is public interest in more accountability and transparency\
    \ into federal spending. Linking federal spending and performance in high impact\
    \ areas using government open data can enhance data transparency, promote economic\
    \ growth and research, and improve services to the American public. The President\u2019\

  Target audience / End user: Emergency shelters, homeless advocates, landlords
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Cynthia and her 1 year old son John have gone to an
    emergency shelter to escape an abusive relationship. Cynthia has not worked since
    her son was born but had previously worked as wait staff. The Emergency Shelter
    had determined that with short term housing assistance and services to connect
    her with child care and helping her locate a job, she could escape her abusive
    situation and live on her own. What the Emergency Shelter needs is an easy way
    to identify available units that Cynthia might be comfortable living, with the
    landlord willing to accept payment from the homeless provider for a specified
    time period.
  Why this problem matters: "Research has shown that for homeless families Rapid Rehousing\
    \ \u2013 having the homeless provider pay the rent on an apartment for 6 to 18\
    \ months and providing intensive services during that time frame \u2013 is a far\
    \ more cost effective way to quickly address families in crisis than other methods\
    \ such as Transitional Housing and longer stays in Emergency Shelter. The problem\
    \ is connecting potential landlords with the providers of services to the homeless."

    guidance counselors; life coaches; community and ministry leaders; service providers;
    philanthropic organizations; federal, state and local government service program
    managers, policy makers, legislators.
  Why this problem matters: Approximately 30 departments and agencies across the federal
    government offer over 200 federal programs that could assist low income families
    in their journeys towards self-sufficiency. There are also innumerable private
    programs intended to achieve the same end. However, the sheer number of programs
    and the lack of integration and accessibility create unnecessary barriers for
    families to find, connect with, and utilize the services that best suit their
    particular needs. Heads of households also lack a way to assess their own strengths
    and weaknesses, to set goals, create a roadmap, and engage with community partners
    to accelerate their journey into economic mobility. Through its EnVision Center
    initiative, HUD designated brick and mortar facilities to serve as centralized
    hubs to support low-income households seeking to achieve self-sufficiency. While
    the centers are effective, their reach is limited to their local areas.

    5, people experiencing homelessness, renters, and members of underrepresented
    minorities
  Why this problem matters: Given that the population count from the Census determines
    redistricting, the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives, and close
    to $700 billion in federal funding are allocated to communities across the nation
    for the next 10 years, ensuring an accurate count is essential. An undercount
    has significant long-term implications for communities. For example, in the 2010
    Census, nearly 1 million children (4.6% of children under the age of 5) were not
    counted. This can contribute to inaccurate school enrollment projections  and
    result in overcrowding and teacher shortages.

  Why this problem matters: DOL places a priority on preparing and providing veterans
    with career opportunities. Both DOL and the Administration also place a priority
    on providing high quality job training through registered apprenticeships (for
    example - a recent Executive Order directed expansion of apprenticeships). By
    showing the relationship between specific military skills to related civilian
    skills, digital tools can help veterans understand what civilian jobs and registered
    apprenticeship programs match to their military skills, helping them to succeed
    in the workforce.

  Background: Opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose have reached crisis levels in
    the United States. From 1999 to 2016, the number of overdose deaths involving
    opioids increased more than five-fold, from about 8,000 to over 42,000. Both prescription
    and illicit opioids contribute to this trend. The opioid crisis extends beyond
    those suffering from addiction and overdose, to their families and communities.
    For example, the rate of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome increased more than
    five-fold between 2004 and 2014 with rising exposure to opioids before birth.
    Local and state governments struggle to provide opioid treatment and preventive
    services and target law enforcement efforts against the increasing traffic of
    illicit opioids. Meanwhile, opioid addiction removes patients and caregivers from
    the workforce. The White House Council of Economic Advisers recently estimated
    the economic toll of the opioid crisis at $504 billion in 2015, or 2.8 percent
    of GDP.
  Challenge: 'Create digital tools and data sharing capabilities to support decisions
    across the broad range of stakeholders responding to the opioid crisis, such as
    public health, public safety, law enforcement, community groups, the private sector,
    and individuals. '

  Background: "Worldwide and across the United States, cities and towns are grappling\
    \ with aging infrastructure, fluctuating populations, and a changing climate.\
    \ Public agencies cannot address these issues alone, which has led to involving\
    \ a growing network of civic stewardship organizations and volunteers to take\
    \ care of the city. Civic stewards ranging from NGOs to grassroots groups of neighbors\
    \ engage in conservation, management, monitoring, education, advocacy, and transformation\
    \ of local environments \u2013 through activities like forest restoration, storm\
    \ water management, community gardening, and more. But better tools are needed\
    \ to identify and track these groups, which often can be informal and hard to\
    \ find. Although public maps show green infrastructure and open space (e.g. forests,\
    \ parks, trees, gardens), there is no comprehensive map showing social infrastructure,\
    \ like the civic groups that care for--or steward--these sites in U.S. cities.\
    \ Over the past decade, USDA Forest Service research has found that civic stewardship\
    \ groups focused on different issues (e.g., tree care, clean water) can be working\
    \ in the same neighborhood, yet unaware of each other. Also, we have found that\
    \ some groups may be working on similar issues, but in different places and without\
    \ coordination. In order for stewards to overcome this isolation and maximize\
    \ the potential for productive collaboration, communities need digital resources\
    \ to locate and connect stewardship groups, as well as community leaders and interested\
    \ residents, across an entire town, city, or region."

  Why this problem matters: "Communities need maps of social infrastructure because\
    \ civic groups are a crucial component of governing a city\u2019s environment.\
    \ Public agencies know which lands they manage and tax maps document private property\

  Background: 'Entrepreneurs create the companies that make up the industries of the
    future, and these companies will in turn recruit and train the workforce of the
    future. Young businesses create nearly all net new jobs in America, and contribute
    to 20% of gross job creation. Science and technology are the foundation for many
    high-growth startups, but companies with capital-intensive research and development
    (R&D) products also face some of the greatest challenges. For America to maintain
    its position as the leader of global innovation, it is imperative that we empower
    entrepreneurs with the support to translate research discovery into the new products
    and services in the marketplace that will make meaningful impact.   '
  Challenge: 'Develop tools to empower entrepreneurs and innovation ecosystem builders
    to find and navigate the variety of resources available across the federal government.  '

  Target audience / End user: Individuals starting or scaling high-growth, science
    and technology-based companies -- at any stage of their entrepreneurial journey
    (early stage, scale up or commercialization); innovation ecosystem builders ,
    including entrepreneur support organizations (ESOs), incubators, accelerators,
    seed funds, and state and local economic development leaders.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: 'Entrepreneurs are able to easily find and access opportunities
    for funding, expertise, equipment and facilities, and other resources, resulting
    in more and more inclusive R&D entrepreneurship. '
  Why this problem matters: "Entrepreneurs need flexible tools that allow them to\
    \ access the right resources at the right time.  Yet information about government\
    \ investment in intellectual property, expertise, equipment and facilities, and\
    \ publicly-available resources to support entrepreneurs is spread across government\
    \ agencies and websites.  Entrepreneurs unfamiliar with government may lack knowledge\
    \ about these resources and have difficulty navigating and finding them, posing\
    \ significant barriers to entry and keeping the best minds and ideas from reaching\
    \ their full potential.  Additionally, resources and access to capital are not\
    \ reaching all Americans evenly.  The best ideas can come from anywhere, but 80%\
    \ of all venture capital (VC) investment has been concentrated in just three states,\
    \ and in 2016, only 1% of VC dollars went to African-American and Latino founders,\
    \ and less than 2% went to female founders. Ensuring that access to resources\
    \ and capital are not relegated to a few regions but to all Americans is critical\
    \ to creating a robust and dynamic workforce and inclusive growth, and ensuring\
    \ the benefits of entrepreneurship not only accrue nationwide, not just in America\u2019\
    s largest cities."

  Background: State, local, and tribal governments, nonprofits, and universities complain
    that, despite the plethora of public data available, it can be dif cult to navigate
    information about federal programs, funding opportunities, and current awards
    to nd the best available resources to address their most pressing challenges.
    This is especially true for lower capacity entities who may not have as much experience
    partnering with the Federal government. Further, to manage and report on these
    awards, these organizations must interface with multiple Federal reporting requirements
    and systems, creating expensive administrative burden. The results of the DATA
    Act section 5 pilot indicate that burden is reduced when recipients are required
    to interact with fewer systems to partner with the Federal government, and when
    identical data can be entered once and reused as necessary.

  Vision for sprint outcomes: Leaders across America maximize return on Federal investments
    by navigating quickly to the resources best positioned to help them solve their
    toughest challenges, and access tools to ef ciently manage this partnership.
  Why this problem matters: "The Federal government spends more than $700 billion\
    \ annually on Federal financial assistance, equivalent to 20% of the Federal budget\
    \ and 5% of the United States gross domestic product. There are more than 40,000\
    \ organizations across the country that rely on Federal financial assistance,\
    \ which often accounts for 20-30% of a state or local government\u2019s revenue.\
    \ Federal grants support everything from local re ghters, police of cers, elementary\
    \ schools, buses, bridges, housing, school lunches, community health centers,\
    \ research to cure cancer or invent technology, and even the pipes we use to drink\
    \ water or ush toilets. Unfortunately, while there are multiple Federal data sets\
    \ and websites about these resources available to the public, not all local leaders\
    \ are able to nd and access the resources that could most bene t their communities.\
    \ Further, these resources are managed in a siloed way, authorized ad hoc over\
    \ time by Congress, and administered by separate departments within agencies,\
    \ with separate goals and requirements. For a single local government managing\
    \ multiple awards, the required reporting processes add up. This fragmentation\
    \ results in missed opportunities for alignment among complimentary Federal programs.\
    \ Our taxpayer dollars could go much further faster if those who use them could\
    \ access and manage them more seamlessly."

  Background: The American dream is fading. Almost all children born in 1940 earned
    more than their parents, but the same was true for only half of children born
    in the 1980s. The decline in mobility is related to growing regional inequality.
    In a reversal of trends of the 20th century, regional income inequality has grown
    in the 2000s, making a person's place of birth an increasingly powerful predictor
    of their future income. The Opportunity Zone provision of the 2017 Tax Cut and
    Jobs Act created an incentive to invest in select low-income communities and is
    the core of a major effort to bring investment and opportunity to communities
    and is the core of a major effort to bring investment and opportunity to communities
    bypassed by recent econmic growth. To promote equality of opportunity across the
    US, we need data and tools to connect investors to the Opportunity Zones where
    their dollars will do the most good. Private sector developers can use their talents
    to bring together multiple sources of public data, as well as private data, to
    create new data products that enable investment in overlooked places.

    leaders, entrepreneurs, and workers of America's 8,764 Opportunity Zones

  Target audience / End user: Entrepreneurs, managers of Opportunity Zone funds, and
    community leaders in Opportunity Zones
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Through better access to consolidated data, more investors,
    entrepreneurs, and community leaders will discover opportunities for economic
    development in overlooked Opportunity Zones.
  Why this problem matters: Opportunity Zones are a promising way to revitalize low-income
    communities and bring jobs to local residents.  But this can only occur if investors
    match their capital with the right people and places.  Many low-income communities
    selected to be Opportunity Zones have few resources to market themselves to investors.
    A community may have easy access to transportation infrastructure, low-cost real
    estate, a well-trained workforce, and natural resources, but lack the means to
    document these assets and bring them to the attention of investors. Investors,
    on the other hand, may tend to flock to the most well-known areas for promising
    investment projects and overlook communities with under-studied and under-appreciated
    potential.

  Target audience / End user: Local officials or other local decision makers; regional
    planning groups; rural or tribal communities; communities that have been impacted
    by recent pandemic outfall, loss of key industry, and/or extreme weather events
    are suggested.
  Why this problem matters: Rural economies must maintain a fine balance between economic
    competitiveness and agricultural and natural land conservation, as well as between
    maintaining existing roads, sewers, and buildings and funding for services needed
    to help residents maintain a good quality of life. In particular, rural communities
    located close to metropolitan areas or amenities (e.g., ski areas, national parks)
    may struggle to preserve their rural character in the face of growth pressures,
    as they experience conversion of farmland and natural land to development. Rural
    communities can achieve their goals for growth and development while maintaining
    their distinctive rural character by encouraging growth in town, where businesses
    can thrive on a walkable main street and families can live close to their daily
    destinations, protect rural landscapes, improve air and water quality, provide
    places for recreation, and create tourist attractions that bring investments into
    the local economy.
