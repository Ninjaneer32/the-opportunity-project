    header: Choose a Problem to Solve
    plain-text: The Opportunity Project aims to solve real-world problems facing individuals and communities. The first step in the process is to identify a problem that your team will work to solve with a data and technology solution. In order to make a solution that really improves lives, it's important to start by working with people experiencing that problem directly to be sure that you're really addressing felt needs. Then find a data set with information that could help to solve that problem, and start building your tool.

    key_actions:
      - number: 1
        text:
          - p: Connect with community groups, local leaders, federal agencies, or non-profits who are mission-driven and close to the ground to identify a meaningful challenge to focus on.
      - number: 2
        text:
          - p: Identify an opportunity for federal or local data to make an impact, for example a problem where making data more accessible would solve a problem.
      - number: 3
        text:
          - p: Remember to consult with stakeholders and future users of your tool before you build anything. See more information on conducting user research in Step 3.

    header: Form a Team
    plain-text: Collaboration is an essential part of The Opportunity Project process. Recruit a team with diverse skills and perspectives so that you can build the best solution for your problem statement. Bring in community leaders, service providers, or people with lived experience who can act as user advocates for your end users, government agencies who can provide guidance with data sets, and a cross-functional technology team with designers and developers to build a high quality digital tool.

    key_actions:
      - number: 1
        text:
          - p: "Include a tech team: data scientists, developers, designers, business thinkers, or anyone else who could help to build the solution."
      - number: 2
        text:
          - p: Reach out to government policy and data experts who may be able to help shape your problem statement or design of your product.
      - number: 3
        text:
          - p: Include User Advocates who work directly on issues related to your challenge, and who work closely with your end-users -- or even better, people who experience the problem directly.
      - number: 4
        text:
          - p: Identify team members who can lead user research, like people who have experience with user-centered design. Everyone should try to ensure the project stays focused on the user and their needs.
        highlight:
          - p: Think early about who will maintain the tool once it's built and who will make sure it gets into the hands of end-users. You may want to identify someone on the team who is responsible for determining how to make your solution sustainable.
