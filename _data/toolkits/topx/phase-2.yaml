    time: "1-2 weeks"
    effort-out-of-4: 1
    empty: 3
    plain-text: The kickoff call launches the sprint in the first week. This is an opportunity for all sprint participants to learn who else is participating, as well as to better understand the problem statements. During the kickoff phase, tech teams should be solidifying which problem statement they will be focusing on and beginning to develop a plan for their work during the sprint.

    time: "3-4 weeks"
    effort-out-of-4: 3
    empty: 1
    plain-text: After the kickoff call, tech teams will begin user research. During this time, tech teams will connect with user advocates, who will offer insights into the communities they represent. A user research milestone call will provide an opportunity to check in with teams on their conversations with user advocates and others who can offer insights into the needs and challenges of potential end users.
    highlight: This phase of sprint facilitation is higher touch, as participants are just beginning to be onboarded and will likely require direction and introductions.

    plain-text: After the user research phase, encourage tech teams to begin exploring potential data sets. A data exploration milestone offers teams an opportunity to learn about relevant data sets from data stewards. Before and after the milestone, tech teams will begin connecting with data stewards via email and phone to learn more about available data sets and ask questions.
    highlight: This phase of sprint facilitation is higher touch, as participants are still being onboarded and will likely require direction and introductions.
