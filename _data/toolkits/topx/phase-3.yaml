    plain-text: Hosting a post-sprint event is an opportunity to showcase and launch the tools developed through the sprint and allow participants to connect. This is optional but we encourage organizing even a small event that includes only sprint participants. If you have capacity, a larger event with outside stakeholders provides an opportunity for teams to share their products with a more diverse audience and to make connections that could help reach end users.
    highlight: The TOP team at the Census Bureau organizes an annual Demo Day to showcase the tools developed through the TOP sprints. On occasion, we are able to highlight a few tools developed through an agency TOPx sprint. If you would like tools developed through your sprint to be considered, please reach out to the TOP team at census.opportunityproject@census.gov.
