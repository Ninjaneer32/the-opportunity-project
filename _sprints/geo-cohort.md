Data and technology have the power to strengthen community resilience and ensure the public is prepared in events of natural disaster. In the Geo-Cohort sprint, tech teams including Bloomberg, Mapbox, Esri and many others developed digital products that allow governments to maintain local address data critical in catastrophic events, help the public take appropriate hazard preparedness actions, and amplify environmental stewardship efforts.
