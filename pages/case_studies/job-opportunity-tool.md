### Transforming Talent Discovery in Mid-Size American Cities

**There is an increasing geographic divide in talent between large and small cities.**
To drive business innovation and productive regional economies in today’s knowledge-based economy, communities need intellectual capital. Large cities like Boston, New York, and San Francisco have seen a decade of entrepreneurship growth and increasing capital investment. But mid-size cities (250,000 - 1 million residents) are only beginning to experience similar activity. In these places where talent pools are less concentrated and more nascent, discovering the right talent is a major barrier for high-growth companies looking to launch and scale.

**The Opportunity Project brought together tech teams, policy and data experts, and community groups to build products that help individuals and companies discover high-growth opportunities.**
12 tech teams, 29 federal data stewards, 46 user advocates and 3 product advisors worked together to focus on building products to address 4 problem statements relating to the American workforce.

**Within the structured 12-week sprint, the team at Redfin successfully built and launched the Job Opportunity Tool**
Within each sprint there are product development milestones that help teams focus on building well-informed products that effectively make use of federal open data. These milestones include: User research, data discovery, and two demos.

*“I really appreciated that [TOP] created a time to work on a project that would have been less feasible… It’s hard to set aside the time for projects that require a few months. It gave us an opportunity to get the outside data and really spend time on the project.” - Redfin*
