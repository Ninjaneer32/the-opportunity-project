See the [design tokens]({{ site.baseurl }}/design-tokens/) section for more on USWDS system styles and palettes.

As a complement to this visual style guidance, we strongly recommend you use [18F’s Content Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/) when writing language for government services.

## USWDS for designers

<div class="site-note"><strong>Note:</strong> USWDS 2 design assets are only currently available in Sketch and Adobe XD formats.</div>

The site contains HTML mockups of common UI components designed to follow USWDS’s visual style guide. To view the specs of each design live on this website (padding, margins, stroke weight, line-height, and so on), use your browser’s developer tools.

USWDS components and tokens are available as an Adobe XD components file and as a suite of Sketch files and libraries. Download the assets and all associated fonts and images from the link below.
