    title: What is your role as an agency?
    text: "Agencies who've run TOP before may be fully equipped to run the TOP process by themselves using our [DIY toolkit](SITE.BASEURL/topx-toolkit/introduction). If this is your first time participating in TOP, our team is here to provide all the support and guidance needed to run a successful sprint. Facilitating a sprint typically requires about 10 hours of work for 12 weeks.


    [Contact Us](https://www.census.gov/forms/contact-top.html) to learn more about how TOP can work at your agency.
