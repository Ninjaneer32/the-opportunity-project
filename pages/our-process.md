      subtitle: The TOP Model
      blurb: |-
        The Opportunity Project (TOP) works through 12-14 week product development cycles—called ‘sprints.’<br><br>


        Federal agencies first define problem statements and then collaborate with technologists and community advocates outside of government, who rapidly build digital products to solve those challenges using open data.

      title: Tech Teams
      blurb: |-
        Tech teams are the companies, universities, non-profits, and students who build digital products in the sprints. They design, develop, and launch the products they build, and own and maintain the products after the sprints. Teams may also develop non-digital products, such as toolkits, policy interventions and more.
