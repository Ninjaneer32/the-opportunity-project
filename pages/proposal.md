# Problem Statement Submission
{: .text-base-darkest }

The problem statement submission window has now closed for our summer/fall 2021 sprint cycle. Off-cycle sprints are still possible so we encourage stakeholders to submit problem statements following the below steps, and The Opportunity Project team will follow up.  Submissions will be reviewed on a rolling basis.
